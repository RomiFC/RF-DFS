# Changelog

## Revision B - 10/24/2023

### Added

- More PTH vias around and directly under RF components.
- Another layer of via picketing around transmission line.
- Silkscreen revision indicator.
- Dimensioning to assembly drawing.

### Changed

- Removed Hammond 1554B compatibility due to difficulties in assembly and weatherproofing SMA connectors. Overall board is smaller at 35mm x 35mm.
- SMA Connectors replaced with Mueller BU-1420761881 which have an upper frequency of 26.5 GHz and better impedance matching at the landing.
- GCPW dimensions from w = 0.415mm, s = 0.6mm, to w = 0.37mm, s = 0.2mm and added 0.375mm taper from SMA clearance to GCPW clearance.

### Fixed

- C9 footprint now correctly matches schematic (0402 --> 1206).
- Moved SMA footprints closer to board edge to reduce filing prior to assembly.

## Revision A - 4/12/2023

### First revision ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

- Board is built to 4-layer OSHPark specifications
- This amplifier showed slightly lower gain than expected, rolling off quicker with frequency. This is likely due to the SMA connector landings which had a known impedance mismatch, resulting in a steep rolloff somewhere between 12 and 18 GHz.
