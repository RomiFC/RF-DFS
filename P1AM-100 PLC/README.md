# PlatformIO

The P1AM-100 is an open source, C/C++ PLC built using the Arduino framework and powered by a SAMD21G18 microcontroller as used in the Arduino MKRZERO. This directory contains the PlatformIO project used to program the microcontroller.

Deployment requires a 24V power supply (Such as the P1-01AC) and the P1-15TD2 15 point discrete output module.
